# Immo_DataAnalysis_V2

Since I was not satisfied with the [V1](https://github.com/Demesmaeker/Immo_data_analysis), and after learning more about Matplotlib and Seaborn, I wanted to remake this work as something I could be proud of.

The purpose of this code is, again, to clean and analyze datas using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
The datas were scrapped from immoweb the 07/09/2020.
